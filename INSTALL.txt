Preliminary steps:

1. npm install -g typescript
2. npm install -g browserify
3. cd lib/Application
4. npm install
5. cd ../postprocessor
6. npm install


Build:

This builds the code in /lib. It must be done after cloning the repository in
order to be able to run the code, or after changes are made to the Typescript
code, if it's desirable to test them (if the script is not run but the code was
built before the wallet will still run, but you'll be testing the last build).
Both scripts are run from the root.

On Windows:

build

On UNIX:

./build.sh
(If the file mode is wrong, please do chmod +x build.sh first and commit the
change.)
